## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Clara

#### I'm a junior software developer and engineering student

- Altough I have mainly worked with **Python** before and I work with **Java** now, I'm always looking into new, interesting stuff. ðŸ‘€

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Java and NLP**. I want to learn some Front-End next (probably React).

- ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» My previous hackathon projects are available on [my Devpost profile](https://devpost.com/crullr99)

- ðŸ“« Reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clara-rull/)
